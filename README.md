Enterprise RDBMS Prototype

A single-node relational database prototype demonstrating transaction processing, MVCC visibility rules, and WAL-based crash recovery.

Purpose

This project exists to demonstrate database internals and systems engineering judgment.
It prioritizes correctness, failure semantics, and explicit trade-offs over performance or feature completeness.

This is not production software.
It is a learning artifact and an interview demonstration tool.

What This Demonstrates

Snapshot isolation via Postgres-style MVCC (xmin / xmax versioning)

First-committer-wins conflict detection for concurrent writers

Write-ahead logging (WAL) with crash recovery and replay

LSM-Tree storage with compaction and MVCC-aware garbage collection

Volcano-style query execution with operator pipelining

B-Tree secondary indexes with MVCC semantics

Explicit Non-Goals

Serializable isolation (write skew is allowed by design)

Distributed replication or consensus

Production performance guarantees

Online schema migration

Adaptive or cost-based query optimization

Architecture Overview

The diagram below shows the end-to-end execution path of a SQL statement, from client request through parsing, transaction management, execution, storage, and durability.

Key Design Decisions
Decision Rationale Trade-off
Snapshot isolation over serializable Simpler MVCC, highlights core mechanics Allows write skew
Indexes not WAL-logged Simplifies recovery logic Slower index rebuild on crash
LSM-Tree over heap B-Tree Write-optimized, modern storage model Read amplification
Single-threaded execution Correctness-first implementation No parallelism
No commit-status table Prototype simplification Visibility edge approximations

Quick Start

# Install dependencies

npm install

# Run all tests

npm test

# Start interactive REPL

npm start

# Start REST API

npm run server

Example Session
db> BEGIN;
Transaction started (xmin=100)

db> CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR, age INT);
Table created

db> INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice', 30);
1 row inserted

db> CREATE INDEX idx_age ON users(age);
Index created

db> SELECT \* FROM users WHERE age > 25;
+----+-------+-----+
| id | name | age |
+----+-------+-----+
| 1 | Alice | 30 |
+----+-------+-----+

db> COMMIT;
Transaction committed

Testing
npm test # All tests
npm run test:unit # MVCC, WAL, storage
npm run test:integration # Recovery and concurrency
npm run test:coverage # Coverage report

Project Status

Current: Phase 2 complete (WAL + Crash Recovery)
Next: Phase 3 (LSM-Tree compaction)

Author Notes

This project demonstrates senior-level understanding of:

Transaction isolation and MVCC visibility rules

Write-ahead logging and crash recovery protocols

Storage engine internals and compaction strategies

Query execution models and operator pipelines

Features that would obscure core algorithms (e.g. distributed consensus, adaptive optimization, connection pooling) are intentionally omitted.
